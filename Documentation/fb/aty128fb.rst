What is aty128fb?
=================

.. [This file is cloned from VesaFB/matroxfb]

This is a driver for a graphic framebuffer for ATI Rage128 based devices
on Intel and PPC boxes.

Advantages:

 * It provides a nice large console (128 cols + 48 lines with 1024x768)
   without using tiny, unreadable fonts.
 * You can run XF68_FBDev on top of /dev/fb0
 * Most important: boot logo :-)

Disadvantages:

 * graphic mode is slower than text mode... but you should not notice
   if you use same resolution as you used in textmode.
 * still experimental.


How to use it?
==============

Switching modes is done using the  video=aty128fb:<resolution>... modedb
boot parameter or using `fbset` program.

See Documentation/fb/modedb.rst for more information on modedb
resolutions.

You should compile in both vgacon (to boot if you remove your Rage128 from
box) and aty128fb (for graphics mode). You should not compile-in vesafb
unless you have primary display on non-Rage128 VBE2.0 device (see
Documentation/fb/vesafb.rst for details).

this document, 8 and 32bpp works fine.  There have been palette issues
when switching from X to console and back to X.  You will have to restart
X to fix this.
