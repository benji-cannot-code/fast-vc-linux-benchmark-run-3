rotary-encoder - a generic driver for GPIO connected devices

Function
--------

Rotary encoders are devices which are connected to the CPU or other
peripherals with two wires. The outputs are phase-shifted by 90 degrees
and by triggering on falling and rising edges, the turn direction can
be determined.

Some encoders have both outputs low in stable states, others also have
a stable state with both outputs high (half-period mode) and some have
a stable state in all steps (quarter-period mode).

The phase diagram of these two outputs look like this::

                  _____       _____       _____
                 |     |     |     |     |     |
  Channel A  ____|     |_____|     |_____|     |____

                 :  :  :  :  :  :  :  :  :  :  :  :
            __       _____       _____       _____
              |     |     |     |     |     |     |
  Channel B   |_____|     |_____|     |_____|     |__

                 :  :  :  :  :  :  :  :  :  :  :  :
  Event          a  b  c  d  a  b  c  d  a  b  c  d

                |<-------->|
	          one step

                |<-->|
	          one step (half-period mode)

                |<>|
	          one step (quarter-period mode)

Events / state machine
----------------------

In half-period mode, state a) and c) above are used to determine the
rotational direction based on the last stable state. Events are reported in
states b) and d) given that the new stable state is different from the last
(i.e. the rotation was not reversed half-way).

Otherwise, the following apply:

a) Rising edge on channel A, channel B in low state
	This state is used to recognize a clockwise turn

b) Rising edge on channel B, channel A in high state
	When entering this state, the encoder is put into 'armed' state,
	meaning that there it has seen half the way of a one-step transition.

c) Falling edge on channel A, channel B in high state
	This state is used to recognize a counter-clockwise turn

d) Falling edge on channel B, channel A in low state
	Parking position. If the encoder enters this state, a full transition
	should have happened, unless it flipped back on half the way. The
	'armed' state tells us about that.

Platform requirements
---------------------

As there is no hardware dependent call in this driver, the platform it is
used with must support gpiolib. Another requirement is that IRQs must be
able to fire on both edges.


Board integration
-----------------

To use this driver in your system, register a platform_device with the
name 'rotary-encoder' and associate the IRQs and some specific platform
data with it. Because the driver uses generic device properties, this can
be done either via device tree, ACPI, or using static board files, like in
example below:

::

	/* board support file example */

	#include <linux/input.h>
	#include <linux/gpio/machine.h>
	#include <linux/property.h>

	#define GPIO_ROTARY_A 1
	#define GPIO_ROTARY_B 2

		.dev_id = "rotary-encoder.0",
		.table = {
			GPIO_LOOKUP_IDX("gpio-0",
					GPIO_ROTARY_A, NULL, 0, GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW),
			GPIO_LOOKUP_IDX("gpio-0",
					GPIO_ROTARY_B, NULL, 1, GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH),
			{ },
		},
	};

	static const struct property_entry rotary_encoder_properties[] __initconst = {
		PROPERTY_ENTRY_U32("rotary-encoder,steps-per-period", 24),
		PROPERTY_ENTRY_U32("linux,axis",		      ABS_X),
		PROPERTY_ENTRY_U32("rotary-encoder,relative_axis",    0),
		{ },
	};

	static struct platform_device rotary_encoder_device = {
		.name		= "rotary-encoder",
		.id		= 0,
	};
/* bench 2680.0.0 24d8ac0287b7 */
/* bench 2680.0.1 6cb46348cda1 */
/* bench 2680.0.2 b4ca04747e51 */

	device_add_properties(&rotary_encoder_device, rotary_encoder_properties);
	platform_device_register(&rotary_encoder_device);

	...

Please consult device tree binding documentation to see all properties
supported by the driver.
