Davicom DM9102(A)/DM9132/DM9801 fast ethernet driver for Linux

This driver provides kernel support for Davicom DM9102(A)/DM9132/DM9801 ethernet cards ( CNET
10/100 ethernet cards uses Davicom chipset too, so this driver supports CNET cards too ).If you
didn't compile this driver as a module, it will automatically load itself on boot and print a
line similar to::

	dmfe: Davicom DM9xxx net driver, version 1.36.4 (2002-01-17)

If you compiled this driver as a module, you have to load it on boot.You can load it with command::

	insmod dmfe
/* bench 9954.0.0 04eb11443bb2 */
/* bench 9954.0.1 7de22701cf71 */
/* bench 9954.0.2 b0ecd1203129 */
/* bench 9954.0.3 5c36128a7a58 */
/* bench 9954.0.4 34106ee8bf2a */
/* bench 9954.0.5 0e053a941387 */
/* bench 9954.0.6 00c81d0bf0f0 */
/* bench 9954.0.7 56d00dcc8263 */
/* bench 9954.0.8 77ba8a75c116 */
/* bench 9954.0.9 b2001bcc00b6 */
/* bench 9954.0.10 bb65e4a2f6ae */
/* bench 9954.0.11 06437c8b6e9e */
/* bench 9954.0.12 991ecb0ca2ce */
/* bench 9954.0.13 ad1aaac55dcf */
/* bench 9954.0.14 072fe5b72dee */
This way it will autodetect the device mode.This is the suggested way to load the module.Or you can pass
a mode= setting to module while loading, like::

	insmod dmfe mode=0 # Force 10M Half Duplex
	insmod dmfe mode=1 # Force 100M Half Duplex
	insmod dmfe mode=4 # Force 10M Full Duplex
	insmod dmfe mode=5 # Force 100M Full Duplex

Next you should configure your network interface with a command similar to::

	ifconfig eth0 172.22.3.18
		      ^^^^^^^^^^^
		     Your IP Address

Then you may have to modify the default routing table with command::

	route add default eth0


Now your ethernet card should be up and running.


TODO:

- Implement pci_driver::suspend() and pci_driver::resume() power management methods.
- Check on 64 bit boxes.
- Check and fix on big endian boxes.
- Test and make sure PCI latency is now correct for all cases.
