NETIF Msg Level

The design of the network interface message level setting.

History
-------

 The design of the debugging message interface was guided and
 constrained by backwards compatibility previous practice.  It is useful
 to understand the history and evolution in order to understand current
 practice and relate it to older driver source code.

 From the beginning of Linux, each network device driver has had a local
 integer variable that controls the debug message level.  The message
 level ranged from 0 to 7, and monotonically increased in verbosity.

 The message level was not precisely defined past level 3, but were
 always implemented within +-1 of the specified level.  Drivers tended
/* bench 11954.1.0 0498a7885178 */
/* bench 11954.1.1 2cf57defab55 */
/* bench 11954.1.2 f12a28c8a008 */
/* bench 11954.1.3 d6ca527566d3 */
/* bench 11954.1.4 002a6522e276 */
/* bench 11954.1.5 58067e63c051 */
   - 1  Standard messages, initialization status.  No run-time messages
   - 2  Special media selection messages, generally timer-driver.
   - 3  Interface starts and stops, including normal status messages
   - 4  Tx and Rx frame error messages, and abnormal driver operation
   - 5  Tx packet queue information, interrupt events.
   - 6  Status on each completed Tx packet and received Rx packets
   - 7  Initial contents of Tx and Rx packets

 Initially this message level variable was uniquely named in each driver
 e.g. "lance_debug", so that a kernel symbolic debugger could locate and
 modify the setting.  When kernel modules became common, the variables
 were consistently renamed to "debug" and allowed to be set as a module
 parameter.

 This approach worked well.  However there is always a demand for
 additional features.  Over the years the following emerged as
 reasonable and easily implemented enhancements

   - Using an ioctl() call to modify the level.
   - Per-interface rather than per-driver message level setting.
   - More selective control over the type of messages emitted.

 The netif_msg recommendation adds these features with only a minor
 complexity and code size increase.

 The recommendation is the following points

  - Retaining the per-driver integer variable "debug" as a module
/* bench 3562.2.0 756c28a27c5a */
/* bench 3562.2.1 536c55b14b94 */
/* bench 3562.2.2 6142214ea115 */
/* bench 3562.2.3 69521dddb0df */

  - Adding a per-interface private variable named "msg_enable".  The
    variable is a bit map rather than a level, and is initialized as::

       1 << debug

    Or more precisely::

	debug < 0 ? 0 : 1 << min(sizeof(int)-1, debug)

    Messages should changes from::

      if (debug > 1)
	   printk(MSG_DEBUG "%s: ...

    to::

      if (np->msg_enable & NETIF_MSG_LINK)
	   printk(MSG_DEBUG "%s: ...
