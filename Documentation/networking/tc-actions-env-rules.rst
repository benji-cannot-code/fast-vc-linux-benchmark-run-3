TC Actions - Environmental Rules
================================


The "environmental" rules for authors of any new tc actions are:

1) If you stealeth or borroweth any packet thou shalt be branching
   from the righteous path and thou shalt cloneth.

   For example if your action queues a packet to be processed later,
   or intentionally branches by redirecting a packet, then you need to
   clone the packet.

2) If you munge any packet thou shalt call pskb_expand_head in the case
/* bench 21379.0.0 f79c2cdc13a5 */
/* bench 21379.0.1 765fcbec333e */
/* bench 21379.0.2 402d919502b3 */
/* bench 21379.0.3 d771636e2850 */
/* bench 21379.0.4 78124d1a9739 */
/* bench 21379.0.5 3995d016fd30 */
/* bench 21379.0.6 547e7d6157da */
/* bench 21379.0.7 04ec16c2bc67 */

3) Dropping packets you don't own is a no-no. You simply return
   TC_ACT_SHOT to the caller and they will drop it.

The "environmental" rules for callers of actions (qdiscs etc) are:

#) Thou art responsible for freeing anything returned as being
   TC_ACT_SHOT/STOLEN/QUEUED. If none of TC_ACT_SHOT/STOLEN/QUEUED is
   returned, then all is great and you don't need to do anything.

Post on netdev if something is unclear.
