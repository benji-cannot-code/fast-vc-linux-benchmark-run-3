Operating FCoE using bnx2fc
===========================
Broadcom FCoE offload through bnx2fc is full stateful hardware offload that
cooperates with all interfaces provided by the Linux ecosystem for FC/FCoE and
SCSI controllers.  As such, FCoE functionality, once enabled is largely

transparent. Devices discovered on the SAN will be registered and unregistered
automatically with the upper storage layers.

Despite the fact that the Broadcom's FCoE offload is fully offloaded, it does
depend on the state of the network interfaces to operate. As such, the network
interface (e.g. eth0) associated with the FCoE offload initiator must be 'up'.
It is recommended that the network interfaces be configured to be brought up
automatically at boot time.

Furthermore, the Broadcom FCoE offload solution creates VLAN interfaces to
support the VLANs that have been discovered for FCoE operation (e.g.
eth0.1001-fcoe).  Do not delete or disable these interfaces or FCoE operation
will be disrupted.

1. Ensure that fcoe-utils package is installed.

2. Configure the interfaces on which bnx2fc driver has to operate on.
Here are the steps to configure:

	a. cd /etc/fcoe
	b. copy cfg-ethx to cfg-eth5 if FCoE has to be enabled on eth5.
	c. Repeat this for all the interfaces where FCoE has to be enabled.
	d. Edit all the cfg-eth files to set "no" for DCB_REQUIRED** field, and
	   "yes" for AUTO_VLAN.
	e. Other configuration parameters should be left as default

3. Ensure that "bnx2fc" is in SUPPORTED_DRIVERS list in /etc/fcoe/config.

4. Start fcoe service. (service fcoe start). If Broadcom devices are present in
the system, bnx2fc driver would automatically claim the interfaces, starts vlan
discovery and log into the targets.

5. "Symbolic Name" in 'fcoeadm -i' output would display if bnx2fc has claimed
the interface.

Eg::

 [root@bh2 ~]# fcoeadm -i
    Description:      NetXtreme II BCM57712 10 Gigabit Ethernet
    Revision:         01

        FC-ID (Port ID):   0x0F0377
        State:             Online

6. Verify the vlan discovery is performed by running ifconfig and notice
   <INTERFACE>.<VLAN>-fcoe interfaces are automatically created.

Refer to fcoeadm manpage for more information on fcoeadm operations to
create/destroy interfaces or to display lun/target information.

NOTE
====
** Broadcom FCoE capable devices implement a DCBX/LLDP client on-chip. Only one
LLDP client is allowed per interface. For proper operation all host software
based DCBX/LLDP clients (e.g. lldpad) must be disabled. To disable lldpad on a
given interface, run the following command::

	lldptool set-lldp -i <interface_name> adminStatus=disabled
