Description
-----------

Versatile Express platform (http://www.arm.com/versatileexpress/) is a
reference & prototyping system for ARM Ltd. processors. It can be set up
from a wide range of boards, each of them containing (apart of the main
chip/FPGA) a number of microcontrollers responsible for platform
configuration and control. Theses microcontrollers can also monitor the
board and its environment by a number of internal and external sensors,
providing information about power lines voltages and currents, board
temperature and power usage. Some of them also calculate consumed energy
and provide a cumulative use counter.

The configuration devices are _not_ memory mapped and must be accessed
via a custom interface, abstracted by the "vexpress_config" API.

As these devices are non-discoverable, they must be described in a Device
Tree passed to the kernel. Details of the DT binding for them can be found
in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/hwmon/vexpress.txt.
