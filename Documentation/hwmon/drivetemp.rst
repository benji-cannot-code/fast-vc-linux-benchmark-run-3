Description
/* bench 23868.1.0 fa940ce32960 */
This driver supports reporting the temperature of disk and solid state
drives with temperature sensors.

If supported, it uses the ATA SCT Command Transport feature to read
the current drive temperature and, if available, temperature limits
as well as historic minimum and maximum temperatures. If SCT Command
Transport is not supported, the driver uses SMART attributes to read
the drive temperature.


Usage Note
----------

Reading the drive temperature may reset the spin down timer on some drives.
This has been observed with WD120EFAX drives, but may be seen with other
drives as well. The same behavior is observed if the 'hdtemp' or 'smartd'
tools are used to access the drive.
With the WD120EFAX drive, reading the drive temperature using the drivetemp
driver is still possible _after_ it transitioned to standby mode, and
reading the drive temperature in this mode will not cause the drive to
change its mode (meaning the drive will not spin up). It is unknown if other
drives experience similar behavior.

Sysfs entries
-------------

Only the temp1_input attribute is always available. Other attributes are
available only if reported by the drive. All temperatures are reported in
milli-degrees Celsius.
