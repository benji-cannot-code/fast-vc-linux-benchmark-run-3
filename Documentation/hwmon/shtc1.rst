Description
-----------

This driver implements support for the Sensirion SHTC1, SHTW1, and SHTC3
chips, a humidity and temperature sensor. Temperature is measured in degrees
celsius, relative humidity is expressed as a percentage.

The device communicates with the I2C protocol. All sensors are set to I2C
address 0x70. See Documentation/i2c/instantiating-devices.rst for methods to
instantiate the device.

There are two options configurable by means of shtc1_platform_data:

1. blocking (pull the I2C clock line down while performing the measurement) or
   non-blocking mode. Blocking mode will guarantee the fastest result but
   the I2C bus will be busy during that time. By default, non-blocking mode
   is used. Make sure clock-stretching works properly on your device if you
   want to use blocking mode.
2. high or low accuracy. High accuracy is used by default and using it is
   strongly recommended.
