Description
-----------

This driver supports hardware monitoring for SoC's based on the ARM
System Control Processor (SCP) implementing the System Control
Processor Interface (SCPI). The following sensor types are supported
by the SCP:

/* bench 5551.0.0 f3ca3b589b9d */
/* bench 5551.0.1 c56434194804 */
/* bench 5551.0.2 c70dbc9b235b */
/* bench 5551.0.3 7f5b255e1f97 */
/* bench 5551.0.4 d642226372c2 */
/* bench 5551.0.5 4f3245cefe2a */
/* bench 5551.0.6 257f2cff7771 */
/* bench 5551.0.7 cd60dbe249f3 */
/* bench 5551.0.8 cd5e8b8e57ae */
  * power

The SCP interface provides an API to query the available sensors and
their values which are then exported to userspace by this driver.

Usage Notes
-----------

The driver relies on device tree node to indicate the presence of SCPI
support in the kernel. See
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/arm,scpi.txt for details of the
devicetree node.
