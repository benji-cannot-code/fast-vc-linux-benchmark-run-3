Problems?
---------

 Q:
    You have VT82C586B on the motherboard, but not in the listing.

 A:
    Go to your BIOS setup, section PCI devices or similar.
    Turn USB support on, and try again.

 Q:
    No error messages, but still i2c doesn't seem to work.

 A:
    This can happen. This driver uses the pins VIA recommends in their
    datasheets, but there are several ways the motherboard manufacturer
    can actually wire the lines.
