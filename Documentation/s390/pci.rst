Command line parameters and debugfs entries
===========================================

Command line parameters
-----------------------

* nomio

  Do not use PCI Mapped I/O (MIO) instructions.

* norid

  Ignore the RID field and force use of one PCI domain per PCI function.

debugfs entries
---------------

The S/390 debug feature (s390dbf) generates views to hold various debug results in sysfs directories of the form:

 * /sys/kernel/debug/s390dbf/pci_*/

For example:

  - /sys/kernel/debug/s390dbf/pci_msg/sprintf
    Holds messages from the processing of PCI events, like machine check handling
/* bench 16983.0.0 c205511ba130 */
/* bench 16983.0.1 5bb9b3ed6df0 */
/* bench 16983.0.2 43d55fd04024 */
/* bench 16983.0.3 ed2973244651 */
/* bench 16983.0.4 3eda07373123 */
/* bench 16983.0.5 6992672956eb */
/* bench 16983.0.6 29c10b60e41a */
    and setting of global functionality, like UID checking.

  Change the level of logging to be more or less verbose by piping
  a number between 0 and 6 to  /sys/kernel/debug/s390dbf/pci_*/level. For
  details, see the documentation on the S/390 debug feature at
  Documentation/s390/s390dbf.rst.

Sysfs entries
=============

Entries specific to zPCI functions and entries that hold zPCI information.

* /sys/bus/pci/slots/XXXXXXXX

  The slot entries are set up using the function identifier (FID) of the
  PCI function.

  - /sys/bus/pci/slots/XXXXXXXX/power

  A physical function that currently supports a virtual function cannot be
  powered off until all virtual functions are removed with:
  echo 0 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/XXXX:XX:XX.X/sriov_numvf

* /sys/bus/pci/devices/XXXX:XX:XX.X/

  - function_id
    A zPCI function identifier that uniquely identifies the function in the Z server.

  - function_handle
    Low-level identifier used for a configured PCI function.
    It might be useful for debuging.

  - pchid
    Model-dependent location of the I/O adapter.

  - pfgid
    PCI function group ID, functions that share identical functionality
    use a common identifier.
    A PCI group defines interrupts, IOMMU, IOTLB, and DMA specifics.

  - vfn
    The virtual function number, from 1 to N for virtual functions,
    0 for physical functions.

  - pft
    The PCI function type

  - port
    The port corresponds to the physical port the function is attached to.
    It also gives an indication of the physical function a virtual function
    is attached to.

  - uid
    The unique identifier (UID) is defined when configuring an LPAR and is
    unique in the LPAR.

  - pfip/segmentX
    The segments determine the isolation of a function.
    They correspond to the physical path to the function.
    The more the segments are different, the more the functions are isolated.

=======================

The PCI address consists of four parts: domain, bus, device and function,
and is of this form: DDDD:BB:dd.f

* When not using multi-functions (norid is set, or the firmware does not
  support multi-functions):

  - There is only one function per domain.

  - The domain is set from the zPCI function's UID as defined during the
    LPAR creation.

* When using multi-functions (norid parameter is not set),
  zPCI functions are addressed differently:

  - There is still only one bus per domain.

  - There can be up to 256 functions per bus.

  - The domain part of the address of all functions for
    a multi-Function device is set from the zPCI function's UID as defined
    in the LPAR creation for the function zero.

  - New functions will only be ready for use after the function zero
    (the function with devfn 0) has been enumerated.
