Notes on register bank usage in the kernel
==========================================

Introduction
------------

The SH-3 and SH-4 CPU families traditionally include a single partial register
bank (selected by SR.RB, only r0 ... r7 are banked), whereas other families
may have more full-featured banking or simply no such capabilities at all.

SR.RB banking
-------------

In the case of this type of banking, banked registers are mapped directly to
r0 ... r7 if SR.RB is set to the bank we are interested in, otherwise ldc/stc
can still be used to reference the banked registers (as r0_bank ... r7_bank)
when in the context of another bank. The developer must keep the SR.RB value
in mind when writing code that utilizes these banked registers, for obvious
reasons. Userspace is also not able to poke at the bank1 values, so these can
be used rather effectively as scratch registers by the kernel.

Presently the kernel uses several of these registers.

	- r0_bank, r1_bank (referenced as k0 and k1, used for scratch
	  registers when doing exception handling).

	- r2_bank (used to track the EXPEVT/INTEVT code)

		- Used by do_IRQ() and friends for doing irq mapping based off
		  of the interrupt exception vector jump table offset

	- r6_bank (global interrupt mask)

/* bench 10498.0.0 e66127b59b41 */
		  interrupt priority level (used by local_irq_enable())

	- r7_bank (current)
