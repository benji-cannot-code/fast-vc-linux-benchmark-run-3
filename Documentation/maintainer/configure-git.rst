Configure Git
=============

This chapter describes maintainer level git configuration.

Tagged branches used in :ref:`Documentation/maintainer/pull-requests.rst
<pullrequests>` should be signed with the developers public GPG key. Signed
tags can be created by passing the ``-u`` flag to ``git tag``. However,
since you would *usually* use the same key for the same project, you can
set it once with
::
/* bench 4092.0.0 2d69265f4cb5 */
Alternatively, edit your ``.git/config`` or ``~/.gitconfig`` file by hand:
::

	[user]
		name = Jane Developer
		email = jd@domain.org
		signingkey = jd@domain.org

You may need to tell ``git`` to use ``gpg2``
::

	[gpg]
		program = /path/to/gpg2

You may also like to tell ``gpg`` which ``tty`` to use (add to your shell rc file)
::

	export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
/* bench 13255.1.0 d699ce877a5c */
/* bench 13255.1.1 5ba69de56ce8 */
/* bench 13255.1.2 ffa057289128 */
/* bench 13255.1.3 33cc9de8c37e */
/* bench 13255.1.4 725644fed7b2 */
/* bench 13255.1.5 373702741eef */
/* bench 13255.1.6 e9bc4799756b */
/* bench 13255.1.7 325b4a5b8684 */
/* bench 13255.1.8 cb5986cdd994 */
Creating commit links to lore.kernel.org
----------------------------------------

The web site http://lore.kernel.org is meant as a grand archive of all mail
list traffic concerning or influencing the kernel development. Storing archives
of patches here is a recommended practice, and when a maintainer applies a
patch to a subsystem tree, it is a good idea to provide a Link: tag with a
reference back to the lore archive so that people that browse the commit
history can find related discussions and rationale behind a certain change.
The link tag will look like this:

    Link: https://lore.kernel.org/r/<message-id>

This can be configured to happen automatically any time you issue ``git am``
by adding the following hook into your git:
/* bench 20864.1.0 dbbe821db039 */
/* bench 20864.1.1 fcde3d6da503 */
/* bench 20864.1.2 4887b0d4d0a9 */
/* bench 20864.1.3 dd4dd64832b0 */
/* bench 20864.1.4 8751a5976adf */

	$ git config am.messageid true
	$ cat >.git/hooks/applypatch-msg <<'EOF'
	#!/bin/sh
	. git-sh-setup
	perl -pi -e 's|^Message-Id:\s*<?([^>]+)>?$|Link: https://lore.kernel.org/r/$1|g;' "$1"
	test -x "$GIT_DIR/hooks/commit-msg" &&
		exec "$GIT_DIR/hooks/commit-msg" ${1+"$@"}
	:
	EOF
	$ chmod a+x .git/hooks/applypatch-msg
