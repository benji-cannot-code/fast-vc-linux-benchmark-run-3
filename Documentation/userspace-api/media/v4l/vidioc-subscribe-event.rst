    * - ``V4L2_EVENT_SUB_FL_SEND_INITIAL``
      - 0x0001
      - When this event is subscribed an initial event will be sent
	containing the current status. This only makes sense for events
	that are triggered by a status change such as ``V4L2_EVENT_CTRL``.
	Other events will ignore this flag.
    * - ``V4L2_EVENT_SUB_FL_ALLOW_FEEDBACK``
      - 0x0002
      - If set, then events directly caused by an ioctl will also be sent
	to the filehandle that called that ioctl. For example, changing a
	control using :ref:`VIDIOC_S_CTRL <VIDIOC_G_CTRL>` will cause
	a V4L2_EVENT_CTRL to be sent back to that same filehandle.
	Normally such events are suppressed to prevent feedback loops

	where an application changes a control to a one value and then
	another, and then receives an event telling it that that control
	has changed to the first value.

	Since it can't tell whether that event was caused by another
	application or by the :ref:`VIDIOC_S_CTRL <VIDIOC_G_CTRL>`
	call it is hard to decide whether to set the control to the value
	in the event, or ignore it.

	Think carefully when you set this flag so you won't get into
	situations like that.

Return Value
============

On success 0 is returned, on error -1 and the ``errno`` variable is set
appropriately. The generic error codes are described at the
:ref:`Generic Error Codes <gen-errors>` chapter.
