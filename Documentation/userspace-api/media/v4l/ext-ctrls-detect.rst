Detect Control IDs
==================

``V4L2_CID_DETECT_CLASS (class)``
    The Detect class descriptor. Calling
    :ref:`VIDIOC_QUERYCTRL` for this control will
    return a description of this control class.

``V4L2_CID_DETECT_MD_MODE (menu)``
    Sets the motion detection mode.

    * - ``V4L2_DETECT_MD_MODE_DISABLED``
      - Disable motion detection.
    * - ``V4L2_DETECT_MD_MODE_GLOBAL``
      - Use a single motion detection threshold.
    * - ``V4L2_DETECT_MD_MODE_THRESHOLD_GRID``
      - The image is divided into a grid, each cell with its own motion
	detection threshold. These thresholds are set through the
	``V4L2_CID_DETECT_MD_THRESHOLD_GRID`` matrix control.
    * - ``V4L2_DETECT_MD_MODE_REGION_GRID``
      - The image is divided into a grid, each cell with its own region
	value that specifies which per-region motion detection thresholds
	should be used. Each region has its own thresholds. How these
	per-region thresholds are set up is driver-specific. The region
	values for the grid are set through the
	``V4L2_CID_DETECT_MD_REGION_GRID`` matrix control.

    ``V4L2_DETECT_MD_MODE_GLOBAL`` motion detection mode.

``V4L2_CID_DETECT_MD_THRESHOLD_GRID (__u16 matrix)``
    Sets the motion detection thresholds for each cell in the grid. To
    be used with the ``V4L2_DETECT_MD_MODE_THRESHOLD_GRID`` motion
    detection mode. Matrix element (0, 0) represents the cell at the
    top-left of the grid.

    be used with the ``V4L2_DETECT_MD_MODE_REGION_GRID`` motion
    detection mode. Matrix element (0, 0) represents the cell at the
    top-left of the grid.
