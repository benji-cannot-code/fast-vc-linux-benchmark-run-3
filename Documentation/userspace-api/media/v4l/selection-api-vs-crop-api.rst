The selection API was introduced to cope with deficiencies of the
older :ref:`CROP API <crop>`, that was designed to control simple
capture devices. Later the cropping API was adopted by video output
drivers. The ioctls are used to select a part of the display were the
video signal is inserted. It should be considered as an API abuse
because the described operation is actually the composing. The
selection API makes a clear distinction between composing and cropping
operations by setting the appropriate targets.

The CROP API lacks any support for composing to and cropping from an
image inside a memory buffer. The application could configure a
capture device to fill only a part of an image by abusing V4L2
API. Cropping a smaller image from a larger one is achieved by setting
the field ``bytesperline`` at struct :c:type:`v4l2_pix_format`.
Introducing an image offsets could be done by modifying field
``m_userptr`` at struct :c:type:`v4l2_buffer` before calling
:ref:`VIDIOC_QBUF <VIDIOC_QBUF>`. Those operations should be avoided
because they are not portable (endianness), and do not work for
macroblock and Bayer formats and mmap buffers.

cropping/composing in a clear, intuitive and portable way. Next, with
the selection API the concepts of the padded target and constraints
flags are introduced. Finally, struct :c:type:`v4l2_crop` and struct
:c:type:`v4l2_cropcap` have no reserved fields. Therefore there is no
way to extend their functionality. The new struct
:c:type:`v4l2_selection` provides a lot of place for future
extensions.

Driver developers are encouraged to implement only selection API. The
former cropping API would be simulated using the new one.
