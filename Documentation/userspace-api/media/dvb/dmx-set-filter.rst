``fd``
    File descriptor returned by :c:func:`open()`.

``params``

    Pointer to structure containing filter parameters.

Description
-----------

This ioctl call sets up a filter according to the filter and mask
parameters provided. A timeout may be defined stating number of seconds
to wait for a section to be loaded. A value of 0 means that no timeout
should be applied. Finally there is a flag field where it is possible to
state whether a section should be CRC-checked, whether the filter should
be a ”one-shot” filter, i.e. if the filtering operation should be
stopped after the first section is received, and whether the filtering
operation should be started immediately (without waiting for a
:ref:`DMX_START` ioctl call). If a filter was previously set-up, this
filter will be canceled, and the receive buffer will be flushed.

Return Value
------------

On success 0 is returned.

On error -1 is returned, and the ``errno`` variable is set
appropriately.

The generic error codes are described at the
:ref:`Generic Error Codes <gen-errors>` chapter.
