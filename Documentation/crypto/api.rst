Programming Interface
=====================

Please note that the kernel crypto API contains the AEAD givcrypt API
(crypto_aead_giv\* and aead_givcrypt\* function calls in
include/crypto/aead.h). This API is obsolete and will be removed in the
future. To obtain the functionality of an AEAD cipher with internal IV
generation, use the IV generator as a regular cipher. For example,
rfc4106(gcm(aes)) is the AEAD cipher with external IV generation and
seqniv(rfc4106(gcm(aes))) implies that the kernel crypto API generates
the IV. Different IV generators are available.
