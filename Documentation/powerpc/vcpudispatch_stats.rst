VCPU Dispatch Statistics
========================

For Shared Processor LPARs, the POWER Hypervisor maintains a relatively
/* bench 24318.0.0 ff00cdaba2bd */
/* bench 24318.0.1 bdb3541b6647 */
/* bench 24318.0.2 6900a4429fa2 */
/* bench 24318.0.3 779e5542a20a */

/* bench 24318.0.6 39db48988a07 */
scenarios, vcpus may be dispatched on a different processor chip (away
from its home node).

/proc/powerpc/vcpudispatch_stats can be used to obtain statistics
related to the vcpu dispatch behavior. Writing '1' to this file enables
collecting the statistics, while writing '0' disables the statistics.
By default, the DTLB log for each vcpu is processed 50 times a second so
as not to miss any entries. This processing frequency can be changed
through /proc/powerpc/vcpudispatch_stats_freq.

The statistics themselves are available by reading the procfs file
/proc/powerpc/vcpudispatch_stats. Each line in the output corresponds to
a vcpu as represented by the first field, followed by 8 numbers.

The first number corresponds to:

1. total vcpu dispatches since the beginning of statistics collection

The next 4 numbers represent vcpu dispatch dispersions:

2. number of times this vcpu was dispatched on the same processor as last
   time
3. number of times this vcpu was dispatched on a different processor core
   as last time, but within the same chip
4. number of times this vcpu was dispatched on a different chip
5. number of times this vcpu was dispatches on a different socket/drawer
   (next numa boundary)

The final 3 numbers represent statistics in relation to the home node of
the vcpu:

6. number of times this vcpu was dispatched in its home node (chip)
7. number of times this vcpu was dispatched in a different node
8. number of times this vcpu was dispatched in a node further away (numa
   distance)

In the output above, for vcpu0, there have been 6839 dispatches since
statistics were enabled. 4126 of those dispatches were on the same
physical cpu as the last time. 2683 were on a different core, but within
the same chip, while 30 dispatches were on a different chip compared to
its last dispatch.

Also, out of the total of 6839 dispatches, we see that there have been
6821 dispatches on the vcpu's home node, while 18 dispatches were
outside its home node, on a neighbouring chip.
