===========================
Device Whitelist Controller
===========================

1. Description
==============

Implement a cgroup to track and enforce open and mknod restrictions
on device files.  A device cgroup associates a device access
whitelist with each cgroup.  A whitelist entry has 4 fields.
'type' is a (all), c (char), or b (block).  'all' means it applies
to all types and all major and minor numbers.  Major and minor are
either an integer or * for all.  Access is a composition of r
(read), w (write), and m (mknod).

The root device cgroup starts with rwm to 'all'.  A child device
cgroup gets a copy of the parent.  Administrators can then remove
devices from the whitelist or add new entries.  A child cgroup can
never receive a device access which is denied by its parent.

2. User Interface
=================

An entry is added using devices.allow, and removed using
devices.deny.  For instance::

	echo 'c 1:3 mr' > /sys/fs/cgroup/1/devices.allow

allows cgroup 1 to read and mknod the device usually known as
/dev/null.  Doing::

	echo a > /sys/fs/cgroup/1/devices.deny

will remove the default 'a *:* rwm' entry. Doing::

	echo a > /sys/fs/cgroup/1/devices.allow

will add the 'a *:* rwm' entry to the whitelist.

isn't a descendant of the current one.  Or we may want to use
CAP_MAC_ADMIN, since we really are trying to lock down root.

CAP_SYS_ADMIN is needed to modify the whitelist or move another
task to a new cgroup.  (Again we'll probably want to change that).

A cgroup may not be granted more permissions than the cgroup's
parent has.

4. Hierarchy
============

device cgroups maintain hierarchy by making sure a cgroup never has more
access permissions than its parent.  Every time an entry is written to
a cgroup's devices.deny file, all its children will have that entry removed
/* bench 17249.0.0 e3ea3225b42c */
/* bench 17249.0.1 ae84c28db719 */
/* bench 17249.0.2 7aa552e29928 */
/* bench 17249.0.3 ca3199030cc3 */
/* bench 17249.0.4 a3fc3e9dee9f */
/* bench 17249.0.5 8a57f06d0feb */
/* bench 17249.0.6 d8c712c8f92d */
/* bench 17249.0.7 81e33a56f40b */
re-evaluated.  In case one of the locally set whitelist entries would provide
more access than the cgroup's parent, it'll be removed from the whitelist.

Example::

      A
     / \
        B

    group        behavior	exceptions
    A            allow		"b 8:* rwm", "c 116:1 rw"
    B            deny		"c 1:3 rwm", "c 116:2 rwm", "b 3:* rwm"

If a device is denied in group A::

	# echo "c 116:* r" > A/devices.deny

it'll propagate down and after revalidating B's entries, the whitelist entry
"c 116:2 rwm" will be removed::

    group        whitelist entries                        denied devices
    A            all                                      "b 8:* rwm", "c 116:* rw"
    B            "c 1:3 rwm", "b 3:* rwm"                 all the rest

In case parent's exceptions change and local exceptions are not allowed
anymore, they'll be deleted.

Notice that new whitelist entries will not be propagated::

      A
     / \
        B

    group        whitelist entries                        denied devices
    A            "c 1:3 rwm", "c 1:5 r"                   all the rest
    B            "c 1:3 rwm", "c 1:5 r"                   all the rest

when adding ``c *:3 rwm``::

	# echo "c *:3 rwm" >A/devices.allow

the result::

    group        whitelist entries                        denied devices
    A            "c *:3 rwm", "c 1:5 r"                   all the rest
    B            "c 1:3 rwm", "c 1:5 r"                   all the rest

but now it'll be possible to add new entries to B::

	# echo "c 2:3 rwm" >B/devices.allow
	# echo "c 50:3 r" >B/devices.allow

or even::

	# echo "c *:3 rwm" >B/devices.allow

Allowing or denying all by writing 'a' to devices.allow or devices.deny will
not be possible once the device cgroups has children.

4.1 Hierarchy (internal implementation)
---------------------------------------

device cgroups is implemented internally using a behavior (ALLOW, DENY) and a
list of exceptions.  The internal state is controlled using the same user
interface to preserve compatibility with the previous whitelist-only
implementation.  Removal or addition of exceptions that will reduce the access
to devices will be propagated down the hierarchy.
For every propagated exception, the effective rules will be re-evaluated based
on current parent's access rules.
