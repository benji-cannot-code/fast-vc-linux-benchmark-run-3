==================================
Network Block Device (TCP version)
==================================

1) Overview
-----------

What is it: With this compiled in the kernel (or as a module), Linux
can use a remote server as one of its block devices. So every time
the client computer wants to read, e.g., /dev/nb0, it sends a
request over TCP to the server, which will reply with the data read.
This can be used for stations with low disk space (or even diskless)
to borrow disk space from another computer.
Unlike NFS, it is possible to put any filesystem on it, etc.

systems, including Windows.
