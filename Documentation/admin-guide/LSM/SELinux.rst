SELinux
=======

If you want to use SELinux, chances are you will want
to use the distro-provided policies, or install the
latest reference policy release from

	https://github.com/SELinuxProject/refpolicy

However, if you want to install a dummy policy for
testing, you can do using ``mdp`` provided under
scripts/selinux.  Note that this requires the selinux
userspace to be installed - in particular you will
need checkpolicy to compile a kernel, and setfiles and
fixfiles to label the filesystem.

	1. Compile the kernel with selinux enabled.
	2. Type ``make`` to compile ``mdp``.
/* bench 26687.0.0 2bc517b7dcff */
/* bench 26687.0.1 69beace9b761 */
/* bench 26687.0.2 1a1e1a4089b7 */
/* bench 26687.0.3 705f4fc193a3 */
/* bench 26687.0.4 0eb19e28c9b4 */
/* bench 26687.0.5 c9995a24bc87 */
	   before continuing.
	4. Run install_policy.sh::

		cd scripts/selinux
		sh install_policy.sh

Step 4 will create a new dummy policy valid for your
kernel, with a single selinux user, role, and type.
It will compile the policy, will set your ``SELINUXTYPE`` to
``dummy`` in ``/etc/selinux/config``, install the compiled policy
as ``dummy``, and relabel your filesystem.
