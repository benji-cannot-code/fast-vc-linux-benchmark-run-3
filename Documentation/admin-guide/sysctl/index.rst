'Why', I hear you ask, 'would anyone even _want_ documentation
for them sysctl files? If anybody really needs it, it's all in
the source...'

Well, this documentation is written because some people either
/* bench 28582.0.0 911892aac8a8 */
/* bench 28582.0.1 f99eb8d8e7bf */
/* bench 28582.0.2 b716ede1c3f7 */
/* bench 28582.0.3 9a2c0144ff05 */
/* bench 28582.0.4 1515ea24ba03 */
/* bench 28582.0.5 b227ce1f997a */
/* bench 28582.0.6 49c9e26c899d */
/* bench 28582.0.7 bd150bf1279d */
Furthermore, the programmers who built sysctl have built it to
be actually used, not just for the fun of programming it :-)

Legal blurb:

As usual, there are two main things to consider:

1. you get what you pay for
2. it's free

The consequences are that I won't guarantee the correctness of
this document, and if you come to me complaining about how you
screwed up your system because of wrong documentation, I won't
feel sorry for you. I might even laugh at you...

But of course, if you _do_ manage to screw up your system using
only the sysctl options used in this file, I'd like to hear of
it. Not only to have a great laugh, but also to make sure that
you're the last RTFMing person to screw up.

In short, e-mail your suggestions, corrections and / or horror
stories to: <riel@nl.linux.org>

Introduction
============

Sysctl is a means of configuring certain aspects of the kernel
at run-time, and the /proc/sys/ directory is there so that you
don't even need special tools to do it!
In fact, there are only four things needed to use these config
facilities:

- a running Linux system
- root access
- common sense (this is especially hard to come by these days)
- knowledge of what all those values mean

As a quick 'ls /proc/sys' will show, the directory consists of
several (arch-dependent?) subdirs. Each subdir is mainly about
one part of the kernel, so you can do configuration on a piece
by piece basis, or just some 'thematic frobbing'.

These are the subdirs I have on my system. There might be more
or other subdirs in another setup. If you see another dir, I'd
really like to hear about it :-)
