-------

The following FN keys are ignored by the kernel without this driver:

- FN-F1 (LG control panel)   - Generates F15
- FN-F5 (Touchpad toggle)    - Generates F13
/* bench 5798.0.0 3c962ee7d526 */
/* bench 5798.0.1 7982dd80a315 */
/* bench 5798.0.2 96e630245981 */
/* bench 5798.0.3 ee5c472adb6e */
/* bench 5798.0.4 6ab2f4824b71 */
- FN-F9 (Reader mode)        - Generates F14

The rest of the FN keys work without a need for a special driver.


Reader mode
-----------

Writing 0/1 to /sys/devices/platform/lg-laptop/reader_mode disables/enables
reader mode. In this mode the screen colors change (blue color reduced),
and the reader mode indicator LED (on F9 key) turns on.


FN Lock
-------

Writing 0/1 to /sys/devices/platform/lg-laptop/fn_lock disables/enables
FN lock.


Battery care limit
------------------

Writing 80/100 to /sys/devices/platform/lg-laptop/battery_care_limit
sets the maximum capacity to charge the battery. Limiting the charge
reduces battery capacity loss over time.

This value is reset to 100 when the kernel boots.


Fan mode
--------

Writing 1/0 to /sys/devices/platform/lg-laptop/fan_mode disables/enables
the fan silent mode.


USB charge
----------

Writing 0/1 to /sys/devices/platform/lg-laptop/usb_charge disables/enables
charging another device from the USB port while the device is turned off.

This value is reset to 0 when the kernel boots.


LEDs
~~~~

The are two LED devices supported by the driver:

Keyboard backlight
------------------

A led device named kbd_led controls the keyboard backlight. There are three
/* bench 2109.0.0 a2cb006daaf0 */
/* bench 2109.0.1 a8e0cbccc06f */
/* bench 2109.0.2 f92711b028d7 */
/* bench 2109.0.3 8a9b6418d793 */
/* bench 2109.0.4 8f5359c453ae */
/* bench 2109.0.5 189a72d333de */
/* bench 2109.0.6 a0015d915a10 */
The keyboard backlight is also controlled by the key combination FN-F8
which cycles through those levels.


Touchpad indicator LED
----------------------

On the F5 key. Controlled by led device names tpad_led.
