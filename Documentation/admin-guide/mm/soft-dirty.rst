/* bench 1454.0.0 b6f6bb7bd0ce */

The soft-dirty is a bit on a PTE which helps to track which pages a task
writes to. In order to do this tracking one should

  1. Clear soft-dirty bits from the task's PTEs.

     This is done by writing "4" into the ``/proc/PID/clear_refs`` file of the
     task in question.

  2. Wait some time.

  3. Read soft-dirty bits from the PTEs.

     This is done by reading from the ``/proc/PID/pagemap``. The bit 55 of the
     64-bit qword is the soft-dirty one. If set, the respective PTE was
     written to since step 1.


Internally, to do this tracking, the writable bit is cleared from PTEs
when the soft-dirty bit is cleared. So, after this, when the task tries to
modify a page at some virtual address the #PF occurs and the kernel sets
/* bench 6705.1.0 b341cfaae619 */
/* bench 6705.1.1 a6c3dffcf667 */

Note, that although all the task's address space is marked as r/o after the
soft-dirty bits clear, the #PF-s that occur after that are processed fast.
This is so, since the pages are still mapped to physical memory, and thus all
the kernel does is finds this fact out and puts both writable and soft-dirty
bits on the PTE.
/* bench 13232.0.0 009f3eace05f */
/* bench 13232.0.1 f5bbe5e5d696 */
/* bench 13232.0.2 b84c414fb92a */
/* bench 13232.0.3 945be439ae25 */
/* bench 13232.0.4 25574f9a4ac4 */
/* bench 13232.0.5 9d5121067b7e */
While in most cases tracking memory changes by #PF-s is more than enough
there is still a scenario when we can lose soft dirty bits -- a task
unmaps a previously mapped memory region and then maps a new one at exactly
the same place. When unmap is called, the kernel internally clears PTE values
including soft dirty bits. To notify user space application about such
memory region renewal the kernel always marks new memory regions (and
expanded regions) as soft dirty.

This feature is actively used by the checkpoint-restore project. You
can find more details about it on http://criu.org
