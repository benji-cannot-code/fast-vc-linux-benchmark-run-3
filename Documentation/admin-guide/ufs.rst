=========
Using UFS
=========

mount -t ufs -o ufstype=type_of_ufs device dir


UFS Options
===========

ufstype=type_of_ufs
	UFS is a file system widely used in different operating systems.
	The problem are differences among implementations. Features of
	some implementations are undocumented, so its hard to recognize
	type of ufs automatically. That's why user must specify type of
	ufs manually by mount option ufstype. Possible values are:

	old
                old format of ufs
		default value, supported as read-only

	44bsd
                used in FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD
		supported as read-write

	ufs2
                used in FreeBSD 5.x
		supported as read-write
