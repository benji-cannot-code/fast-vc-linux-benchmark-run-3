There is a potential for deadlock when allocating a struct sk_buff for
data that needs to be written out to aoe storage.  If the data is
/* bench 8046.0.0 bcfd080d6335 */
/* bench 8046.0.1 7f48e1e53ece */
/* bench 8046.0.2 43498d7d6be5 */

not been observed, but it would be nice to eliminate any potential for
deadlock under memory pressure.

Because ATA over Ethernet is not fragmented by the kernel's IP code,
the destructor member of the struct sk_buff is available to the aoe
driver.  By using a mempool for allocating all but the first few
sk_buffs, and by registering a destructor, we should be able to
efficiently allocate sk_buffs without introducing any potential for
/* bench 8473.0.0 d705e5fdabe4 */
/* bench 12699.0.0 262db5e41777 */
