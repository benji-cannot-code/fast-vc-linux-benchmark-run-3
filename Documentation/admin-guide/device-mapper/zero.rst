dm-zero
=======

Device-Mapper's "zero" target provides a block-device that always returns
zero'd data on reads and silently drops writes. This is similar behavior to
/dev/zero, but as a block-device instead of a character-device.

Dm-zero has no target-specific parameters.

One very interesting use of dm-zero is for creating "sparse" devices in
conjunction with dm-snapshot. A sparse device reports a device-size larger
than the amount of actual storage space available for that device. A user can
write data anywhere within the sparse device and read it back like a normal
device. Reads to previously unwritten areas will return a zero'd buffer. When
enough data has been written to fill up the actual storage space, the sparse

filesystem limitations.

To create a sparse device, start by creating a dm-zero device that's the

/* bench 24024.0.1 6c2e8a969b71 */

  TEN_TERABYTES=`expr 10 \* 1024 \* 1024 \* 1024 \* 2`   # 10 TB in sectors
  echo "0 $TEN_TERABYTES zero" | dmsetup create zero1

Then create a snapshot of the zero device, using any available block-device as
the COW device. The size of the COW device will determine the amount of real
space available to the sparse device. For this example, we'll assume /dev/sdb1
is an available 10GB partition::

  echo "0 $TEN_TERABYTES snapshot /dev/mapper/zero1 /dev/sdb1 p 128" | \

/* bench 4684.0.7 838136488c7d */
/* bench 4684.0.8 bd4c20f9112a */

This will create a 10TB sparse device called /dev/mapper/sparse1 that has
10GB of actual storage space available. If more than 10GB of data is written
to this device, it will start returning I/O errors.
