Cards List
==========

The media subsystem provide support for lots of PCI and USB drivers, plus
platform-specific drivers. It also contains several ancillary I²C drivers.

The platform-specific drivers are usually present on embedded systems,
or are supported by the main board. Usually, setting them is done via
OpenFirmware or ACPI.

The PCI and USB drivers, however, are independent of the system's board,
and may be added/removed by the user.
