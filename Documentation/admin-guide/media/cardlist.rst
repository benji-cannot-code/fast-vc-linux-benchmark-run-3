The media subsystem provide support for lots of PCI and USB drivers, plus
platform-specific drivers. It also contains several ancillary I²C drivers.

The platform-specific drivers are usually present on embedded systems,
/* bench 3971.0.0 511ed26f81fe */
/* bench 3971.0.1 96ca075f87f1 */
/* bench 3971.0.2 ad27cf5701fb */
/* bench 3971.0.3 cfffbf133610 */
/* bench 3971.0.4 9d0666d1e54d */
/* bench 3971.0.5 6ee1b5e2b2ed */
/* bench 3971.0.6 f0beeea7227a */
/* bench 3971.0.7 9224bbf6560f */
/* bench 3971.0.8 637a18016293 */
/* bench 3971.0.9 5bb456c4caa3 */
/* bench 3971.0.10 baf9dcbf967f */

The PCI and USB drivers, however, are independent of the system's board,
and may be added/removed by the user.
