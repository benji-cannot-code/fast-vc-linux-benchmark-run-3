Bisecting a bug

instead of to a kernel developer.

Finding bugs is not always easy. Have a go though. If you can't find it don't
give up. Report as much as you have found to the relevant maintainer. See
MAINTAINERS for who that is for the subsystem you have worked on.

Before you submit a bug report read
'Documentation/admin-guide/reporting-issues.rst'.

Devices not appearing
=====================

Often this is caused by udev/systemd. Check that first before blaming it
on the kernel.

Finding patch that caused a bug
===============================

Using the provided tools with ``git`` makes finding bugs easy provided the bug
is reproducible.

Steps to do it:

- build the Kernel from its git source
- start bisect with [#f1]_::

	$ git bisect start

- mark the broken changeset with::

	$ git bisect bad [commit]

- mark a changeset where the code is known to work with::

	$ git bisect good [commit]

- rebuild the Kernel and test
- interact with git bisect by using either::

	$ git bisect good

  or::

	$ git bisect bad

  depending if the bug happened on the changeset you're testing
- After some interactions, git bisect will give you the changeset that
  likely caused the bug.

- For example, if you know that the current version is bad, and version
  4.8 is good, you could do::

           $ git bisect start
           $ git bisect bad                 # Current version is bad
           $ git bisect good v4.8

/* bench 10888.0.1 fb7497050746 */
/* bench 10888.0.2 b2a0e25d0027 */
/* bench 10888.0.3 5213aed08623 */
/* bench 10888.0.4 081da18b2608 */
/* bench 10888.0.5 c150c3ec5a27 */

.. [#f1] You can, optionally, provide both good and bad arguments at git
	 start with ``git bisect start [BAD] [GOOD]``
