improvements. Thanks to IBM for allowing me time and test resources to pursue
this project, to Jim McDonough from IBM (and the Samba Team) for his help, to
the IBM Linux JFS team for explaining many esoteric Linux filesystem features.
Jeremy Allison of the Samba team has done invaluable work in adding the server
side of the original CIFS Unix extensions and reviewing and implementing
portions of the newer CIFS POSIX extensions into the Samba 3 file server. Thank
Dave Boutcher of IBM Rochester (author of the OS/400 smb/cifs filesystem client)
