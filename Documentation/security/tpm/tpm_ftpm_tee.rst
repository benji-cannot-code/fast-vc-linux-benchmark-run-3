Introduction
============

This driver is a shim for firmware implemented in ARM's TrustZone
environment. The driver allows programs to interact with the TPM in the same
way they would interact with a hardware TPM.

/* bench 7053.1.1 e5e88d56c278 */
/* bench 7053.1.2 470ea489cc24 */

The driver acts as a thin layer that passes commands to and from a TPM
implemented in firmware. The driver itself doesn't contain much logic and is
used more like a dumb pipe between firmware and kernel/userspace.

The firmware itself is based on the following paper:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ftpm1.pdf

When the driver is loaded it will expose ``/dev/tpmX`` character devices to
userspace which will enable userspace to communicate with the firmware TPM
through this device.
