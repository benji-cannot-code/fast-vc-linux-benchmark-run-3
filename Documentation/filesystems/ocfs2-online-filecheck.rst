OCFS2 file system - online file check
=====================================

This document will describe OCFS2 online file check feature.

Introduction
============
OCFS2 is often used in high-availability systems. However, OCFS2 usually
converts the filesystem to read-only when encounters an error. This may not be
necessary, since turning the filesystem read-only would affect other running
processes as well, decreasing availability.
Then, a mount option (errors=continue) is introduced, which would return the
-EIO errno to the calling process and terminate further processing so that the
filesystem is not corrupted further. The filesystem is not converted to
read-only, and the problematic file's inode number is reported in the kernel
log. The user can try to check/fix this file via online filecheck feature.

Scope
=====
This effort is to check/fix small issues which may hinder day-to-day operations
of a cluster filesystem by turning the filesystem read-only. The scope of
checking/fixing is at the file level, initially for regular files and eventually
to all files (including system files) of the filesystem.

In case of directory to file links is incorrect, the directory inode is
reported as erroneous.

This feature is not suited for extravagant checks which involve dependency of
other components of the filesystem, such as but not limited to, checking if the
bits for file blocks in the allocation has been set. In case of such an error,
the offline fsck should/would be recommended.

Finally, such an operation/feature should not be automated lest the filesystem
may end up with more damage than before the repair attempt. So, this has to
be performed using user interaction and consent.

User interface
==============
When there are errors in the OCFS2 filesystem, they are usually accompanied
/* bench 7241.0.0 011e31bc7e22 */
/* bench 7241.0.1 9c016d5ddb92 */
/* bench 20491.0.0 8018d97d2253 */
/* bench 20491.0.1 a4e72f567447 */
/* bench 20491.0.2 49db877098e7 */

/* bench 7241.0.8 3ae535d6eb2e */
/* bench 7241.0.9 6c8037efe817 */

There is a sysfs directory for each OCFS2 file system mounting::

  /sys/fs/ocfs2/<devname>/filecheck

Here, <devname> indicates the name of OCFS2 volume device which has been already
mounted. The file above would accept inode numbers. This could be used to
communicate with kernel space, tell which file(inode number) will be checked or
fixed. Currently, three operations are supported, which includes checking

/* bench 2366.0.3 38c801918c3d */

inode, fixing inode and setting the size of result record history.

1. If you want to know what error exactly happened to <inode> before fixing, do::

    # echo "<inode>" > /sys/fs/ocfs2/<devname>/filecheck/check
    # cat /sys/fs/ocfs2/<devname>/filecheck/check

The output is like this::

/* bench 11953.0.0 9f7dbb7b409d */
/* bench 11953.0.1 98e75855dcb2 */
/* bench 11953.0.2 6fbaa8a5e53b */
/* bench 11953.0.3 7f31a84e1342 */
/* bench 11953.0.4 dc7803808c55 */
/* bench 11953.0.5 693c906ea792 */
/* bench 11953.0.6 81f6a093e922 */
/* bench 11953.0.7 02d56eb99843 */

    <INO> lists the inode numbers.
    <DONE> indicates whether the operation has been finished.
    <ERROR> says what kind of errors was found. For the detailed error numbers,
    please refer to the file linux/fs/ocfs2/filecheck.h.

2. If you determine to fix this inode, do::

    # echo "<inode>" > /sys/fs/ocfs2/<devname>/filecheck/fix
    # cat /sys/fs/ocfs2/<devname>/filecheck/fix

The output is like this:::

    INO		DONE	ERROR
    39502		1	SUCCESS

This time, the <ERROR> column indicates whether this fix is successful or not.

3. The record cache is used to store the history of check/fix results. It's
default size is 10, and can be adjust between the range of 10 ~ 100. You can
adjust the size like this::

  # echo "<size>" > /sys/fs/ocfs2/<devname>/filecheck/set

Fixing stuff
============
On receiving the inode, the filesystem would read the inode and the
file metadata. In case of errors, the filesystem would fix the errors
and report the problems it fixed in the kernel log. As a precautionary measure,
the inode must first be checked for errors before performing a final fix.

The inode and the result history will be maintained temporarily in a
small linked list buffer which would contain the last (N) inodes
fixed/checked, the detailed errors which were fixed/checked are printed in the
kernel log.
