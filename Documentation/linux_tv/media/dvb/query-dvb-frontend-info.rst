*****************************
Querying frontend information
*****************************

Usually, the first thing to do when the frontend is opened is to check
the frontend capabilities. This is done using
:ref:`FE_GET_INFO`. This ioctl will enumerate the
DVB API version and other characteristics about the frontend, and can be
opened either in read only or read/write mode.
