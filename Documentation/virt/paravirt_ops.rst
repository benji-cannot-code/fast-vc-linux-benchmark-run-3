============

Linux provides support for different hypervisor virtualization technologies.
Historically different binary kernels would be required in order to support
different hypervisors, this restriction was removed with pv_ops.
Linux pv_ops is a virtualization API which enables support for different
hypervisors. It allows each hypervisor to override critical operations and

/* bench 16591.1.1 725d35da1d6c */
pv_ops provides a set of function pointers which represent operations
corresponding to low level critical instructions and high level
functionalities in various areas. pv-ops allows for optimizations at run
time by enabling binary patching of the low-ops critical operations
at boot time.

pv_ops operations are classified into three categories:

- simple indirect call
   These operations correspond to high level functionality where it is
   known that the overhead of indirect call isn't very important.

- indirect call which allows optimization with binary patch
