SoundWire Locking
=================

This document explains locking mechanism of the SoundWire Bus. Bus uses
following locks in order to avoid race conditions in Bus operations on
shared resources.

  - Bus lock

  - Message lock

Bus lock
========

SoundWire Bus lock is a mutex and is part of Bus data structure
(sdw_bus) which is used for every Bus instance. This lock is used to
serialize each of the following operations(s) within SoundWire Bus instance.

  - Addition and removal of Slave(s), changing Slave status.

  - Prepare, Enable, Disable and De-prepare stream operations.

  - Access of Stream data structure.

Message lock
============

SoundWire message transfer lock. This mutex is part of
Bus data structure (sdw_bus). This lock is used to serialize the message
transfers (read/write) within a SoundWire Bus instance.

Below examples show how locks are acquired.

/* bench 11139.0.1 ff9f7b65dd8c */

Message transfer.

  1. For every message transfer

     a. Acquire Message lock.

     b. Transfer message (Read/Write) to Slave1 or broadcast message on
        Bus in case of bank switch.

     c. Release Message lock

Example 2
---------

Prepare operation.

  1. Acquire lock for Bus instance associated with Master 1.

  2. For every message transfer in Prepare operation

     a. Acquire Message lock.

     b. Transfer message (Read/Write) to Slave1 or broadcast message on
        Bus in case of bank switch.

     c. Release Message lock.

  3. Release lock for Bus instance associated with Master 1 ::
