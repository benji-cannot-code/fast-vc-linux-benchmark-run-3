Digital TV (DVB) devices
------------------------

Digital TV devices are implemented by several different drivers:

- Frontend drivers that are usually implemented as two separate drivers:

  - A tuner driver that implements the logic which commands the part of
    the hardware responsible for tuning into a digital TV transponder or
    physical channel. The output of a tuner is usually a baseband or
    Intermediate Frequency (IF) signal;

  - A demodulator driver (a.k.a "demod") that implements the logic which
    commands the digital TV decoding hardware. The output of a demod is
    a digital stream, with multiple audio, video and data channels typically
    multiplexed using MPEG Transport Stream [#f1]_.

On most hardware, the frontend drivers talk with the bridge driver using an
I2C bus.

.. [#f1] Some standards use TCP/IP for multiplexing data, like DVB-H (an
   abandoned standard, not used anymore) and ATSC version 3.0 current
   proposals. Currently, the DVB subsystem doesn't implement those standards.
