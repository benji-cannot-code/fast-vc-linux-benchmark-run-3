0x47 is the sync byte for MPEG-2 transport stream packets.
Datasheet incorrectly states to use 47 decimal. 188 is the length.
All DVB compliant frontends output packets with this start code.

Hauppauge WinTV cx88 IR information
-----------------------------------

The controls for the mux are GPIO [0,1] for source, and GPIO 2 for muting.

====== ======== =================================================
GPIO0  GPIO1
====== ======== =================================================
  0        0    TV Audio
  1        0    FM radio
  0        1    Line-In
  1        1    Mono tuner bypass or CD passthru (tuner specific)
====== ======== =================================================

GPIO 16(I believe) is tied to the IR port (if present).


From the data sheet:

- Register 24'h20004  PCI Interrupt Status

 - bit [18]  IR_SMP_INT Set when 32 input samples have been collected over
 - gpio[16] pin into GP_SAMPLE register.

What's missing from the data sheet:

- Setup 4KHz sampling rate (roughly 2x oversampled; good enough for our RC5
  compat remote)
- set register 0x35C050 to  0xa80a80
- enable sampling
- set register 0x35C054 to 0x5
- enable the IRQ bit 18 in the interrupt mask register (and
  provide for a handler)

GP_SAMPLE register is at 0x35C058

Bits are then right shifted into the GP_SAMPLE register at the specified
rate; you get an interrupt when a full DWORD is received.
You need to recover the actual RC5 bits out of the (oversampled) IR sensor
bits. (Hint: look for the 0/1and 1/0 crossings of the RC5 bi-phase data)  An
actual raw RC5 code will span 2-3 DWORDS, depending on the actual alignment.

I'm pretty sure when no IR signal is present the receiver is always in a
marking state(1); but stray light, etc can cause intermittent noise values
as well.  Remember, this is a free running sample of the IR receiver state
over time, so don't assume any sample starts at any particular place.
