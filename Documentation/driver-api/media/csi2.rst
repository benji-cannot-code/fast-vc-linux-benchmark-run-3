MIPI CSI-2
==========

CSI-2 is a data bus intended for transferring images from cameras to
the host SoC. It is defined by the `MIPI alliance`_.

Media bus formats
-----------------

See :ref:`v4l2-mbus-pixelcode` for details on which media bus formats should
be used for CSI-2 interfaces.

Transmitter drivers
-------------------

CSI-2 transmitter, such as a sensor or a TV tuner, drivers need to
provide the CSI-2 receiver with information on the CSI-2 bus
configuration. These include the V4L2_CID_LINK_FREQ and
V4L2_CID_PIXEL_RATE controls and
(:c:type:`v4l2_subdev_video_ops`->s_stream() callback). These
interface elements must be present on the sub-device represents the
CSI-2 transmitter.

The value of the V4L2_CID_PIXEL_RATE is calculated as follows::

	pixel_rate = link_freq * 2 * nr_of_lanes * 16 / k / bits_per_sample

       be obtained from the OF endpoint configuration.

The transmitter drivers must, if possible, configure the CSI-2
transmitter to *LP-11 mode* whenever the transmitter is powered on but
not active, and maintain *LP-11 mode* until stream on. Only at stream
on should the transmitter activate the clock on the clock lane and
transition to *HS mode*.

Some transmitters do this automatically but some have to be explicitly
programmed to do so, and some are unable to do so altogether due to
hardware constraints.

Stopping the transmitter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A transmitter stops sending the stream of images as a result of
calling the ``.s_stream()`` callback. Some transmitters may stop the
stream at a frame boundary whereas others stop immediately,
effectively leaving the current frame unfinished. The receiver driver
should not make assumptions either way, but function properly in both
cases.

Receiver drivers
----------------

Before the receiver driver may enable the CSI-2 transmitter by using
the :c:type:`v4l2_subdev_video_ops`->s_stream(), it must have powered
the transmitter up by using the
:c:type:`v4l2_subdev_core_ops`->s_power() callback. This may take
place either indirectly by using :c:func:`v4l2_pipeline_pm_get` or
directly.

Formats
-------

The media bus pixel codes document parallel formats. Should the pixel data be
transported over a serial bus, the media bus pixel code that describes a
parallel format that transfers a sample on a single clock cycle is used.
