This document describes the usage of the AML debugger embedded in the Linux
kernel.

1. Build the debugger
=====================

The following kernel configuration items are required to enable the AML
debugger interface from the Linux kernel::

   CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUGGER=y
   CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUGGER_USER=m

The userspace utilities can be built from the kernel source tree using
the following commands::

   $ cd tools
   $ make acpi

The resultant userspace tool binary is then located at::

   tools/power/acpi/acpidbg

It can be installed to system directories by running "make install" (as a
sufficiently privileged user).

2. Start the userspace debugger interface
=========================================

After booting the kernel with the debugger built-in, the debugger can be
started by using the following commands::

   # mount -t debugfs none /sys/kernel/debug
   # modprobe acpi_dbg
/* bench 4037.0.0 8cb45697e311 */
/* bench 4037.0.1 81ffc519a26b */
/* bench 4037.0.2 053f30d4eb52 */
/* bench 4037.0.3 ea9621c25171 */
/* bench 4037.0.4 a588ad5a11fe */
/* bench 4037.0.5 e19533a76480 */
/* bench 4037.0.6 bad46e6fe2f9 */
/* bench 4037.0.7 549b7bc5600c */
/* bench 4037.0.8 dfaf9e9a788f */
/* bench 4037.0.9 ad2f3a89f8f8 */
debugger commands.

The commands are documented in the "ACPICA Overview and Programmer Reference"
that can be downloaded from

https://acpica.org/documentation

The detailed debugger commands reference is located in Chapter 12 "ACPICA
Debugger Reference".  The "help" command can be used for a quick reference.

3. Stop the userspace debugger interface
========================================

The interactive debugger interface can be closed by pressing Ctrl+C or using
the "quit" or "exit" commands.  When finished, unload the module with::

   # rmmod acpi_dbg

The module unloading may fail if there is an acpidbg instance running.

4. Run the debugger in a script
===============================

It may be useful to run the AML debugger in a test script. "acpidbg" supports
this in a special "batch" mode.  For example, the following command outputs
the entire ACPI namespace::

   # acpidbg -b "namespace"
/* bench 10011.0.0 7dfa188de6b8 */
/* bench 10011.0.1 7e4ac7e6fcba */
/* bench 10011.0.2 e212774f4136 */
/* bench 10011.0.3 5d1c80d804fc */
/* bench 10011.0.4 6f73ea497c73 */
