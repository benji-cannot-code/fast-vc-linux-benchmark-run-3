/*
 * The semid64_ds structure for most architectures (though it came from x86_32
 * originally). Note extra padding because this structure is passed back and
 * forth between kernel and user space.
 *
 * semid64_ds was originally meant to be architecture specific, but
 * everyone just ended up making identical copies without specific
 * optimizations, so we may just as well all use the same one.
 *
 * 64 bit architectures use a 64-bit long time field here, while
 * 32 bit architectures have a pair of unsigned long values.
 *
 * On big-endian systems, the padding is in the wrong place for
 * historic reasons, so user space has to reconstruct a time_t
 * value using
 *
 * user_semid_ds.sem_otime = kernel_semid64_ds.sem_otime +
 *		((long long)kernel_semid64_ds.sem_otime_high << 32)
