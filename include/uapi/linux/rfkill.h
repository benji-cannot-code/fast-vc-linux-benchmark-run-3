/**
 * DOC: Extensibility
 *
 * Originally, we had planned to allow backward and forward compatible
 * changes by just adding fields at the end of the structure that are
 * then not reported on older kernels on read(), and not written to by
 * older kernels on write(), with the kernel reporting the size it did
 * accept as the result.
 *
 * This would have allowed userspace to detect on read() and write()
 * which kernel structure version it was dealing with, and if was just
 * recompiled it would have gotten the new fields, but obviously not
 * accessed them, but things should've continued to work.
 *
 * Unfortunately, while actually exercising this mechanism to add the
 * hard block reasons field, we found that userspace (notably systemd)
 * did all kinds of fun things not in line with this scheme:
 *
 * 1. treat the (expected) short writes as an error;
 * 2. ask to read sizeof(struct rfkill_event) but then compare the
 *    actual return value to RFKILL_EVENT_SIZE_V1 and treat any
 *    mismatch as an error.
 *
 * As a consequence, just recompiling with a new struct version caused
 * things to no longer work correctly on old and new kernels.
 *
 * Hence, we've rolled back &struct rfkill_event to the original version
 * and added &struct rfkill_event_ext. This effectively reverts to the

 * Userspace using &struct rfkill_event_ext must adhere to the following
 * rules

 *    running on an older kernel;
 * 2. accept short reads, knowing that this means it's running on an
