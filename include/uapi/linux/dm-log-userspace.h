/*
 * The device-mapper userspace log module consists of a kernel component and
 * a user-space component.  The kernel component implements the API defined
 * in dm-dirty-log.h.  Its purpose is simply to pass the parameters and
 * return values of those API functions between kernel and user-space.
 *
 * Below are defined the 'request_types' - DM_ULOG_CTR, DM_ULOG_DTR, etc.
 * These request types represent the different functions in the device-mapper
 * dirty log API.  Each of these is described in more detail below.
 *
 * The user-space program must listen for requests from the kernel (representing

/* bench 299.4.1 72c518dd04d4 */
/* bench 299.4.2 bd0ae9c878af */
/* bench 299.4.3 266765201453 */
/* bench 299.4.4 ad9675b32143 */
/* bench 299.4.5 cbddaac10cdc */
 *
 * User-space begins by setting up the communication link (error checking
 * removed for clarity):
 *	fd = socket(PF_NETLINK, SOCK_DGRAM, NETLINK_CONNECTOR);
 *	addr.nl_family = AF_NETLINK;
 *	addr.nl_groups = CN_IDX_DM;
 *	addr.nl_pid = 0;
 *	r = bind(fd, (struct sockaddr *) &addr, sizeof(addr));
 *	opt = addr.nl_groups;
 *	setsockopt(fd, SOL_NETLINK, NETLINK_ADD_MEMBERSHIP, &opt, sizeof(opt));
 *
 * User-space will then wait to receive requests form the kernel, which it
 * will process as described below.  The requests are received in the form,
 * ((struct dm_ulog_request) + (additional data)).  Depending on the request
 * type, there may or may not be 'additional data'.  In the descriptions below,
 * you will see 'Payload-to-userspace' and 'Payload-to-kernel'.  The
 * 'Payload-to-userspace' is what the kernel sends in 'additional data' as
 * necessary parameters to complete the request.  The 'Payload-to-kernel' is
 * the 'additional data' returned to the kernel that contains the necessary
 * results of the request.  The 'data_size' field in the dm_ulog_request
 * structure denotes the availability and amount of payload data.
