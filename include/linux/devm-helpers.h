 * Functions which do automatically cancel operations or release resources upon
 * driver detach.
 *
 * These should be helpful to avoid mixing the manual and devm-based resource
 * management which can be source of annoying, rarely occurring,
 * hard-to-reproduce bugs.
 *
 * Please take into account that devm based cancellation may be performed some
 * time after the remove() is ran.
 *
 * Thus mixing devm and manual resource management can easily cause problems
 * when unwinding operations with dependencies. IRQ scheduling a work in a queue
 * is typical example where IRQs are often devm-managed and WQs are manually
 * cleaned at remove(). If IRQs are not manually freed at remove() (and this is
 * often the case when we use devm for IRQs) we have a period of time after
 * remove() - and before devm managed IRQs are freed - where new IRQ may fire
 * and schedule a work item which won't be cancelled because remove() was
 * already ran.
