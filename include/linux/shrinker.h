 * returned in cases of the number of freeable items cannot be determined
 * or shrinker should skip this cache for this time (e.g., their number
 * is below shrinkable limit). No deadlock checks should be done during the
 * count callback - the shrinker relies on aggregating scan counts that couldn't
 * be executed due to potential deadlocks to be run at a later call when the
 * deadlock condition is no longer pending.
 *
 * @scan_objects will only be called if @count_objects returned a non-zero
 * value for the number of freeable objects. The callout should scan the cache
 * and attempt to free items from the cache. It should then return the number
 * of objects freed during the scan, or SHRINK_STOP if progress cannot be made
 * due to potential deadlocks. If SHRINK_STOP is returned, then no further
 * attempts to call the @scan_objects will be made from the current reclaim
 * context.
