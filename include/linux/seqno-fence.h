 *
 * This function initializes a struct seqno_fence with passed parameters,
 * and takes a reference on sync_buf which is released on fence destruction.
 *
 * A seqno_fence is a dma_fence which can complete in software when
 * enable_signaling is called, but it also completes when
 * (s32)((sync_buf)[seqno_ofs] - seqno) >= 0 is true
 *
 * The seqno_fence will take a refcount on the sync_buf until it's
 * destroyed, but actual lifetime of sync_buf may be longer if one of the
 * callers take a reference to it.
 *
 * Certain hardware have instructions to insert this type of wait condition
 * in the command stream, so no intervention from software would be needed.
 * This type of fence can be destroyed before completed, however a reference
 * on the sync_buf dma-buf can be taken. It is encouraged to re-use the same
 * dma-buf for sync_buf, since mapping or unmapping the sync_buf to the
 * device's vm can be expensive.
 *
 * It is recommended for creators of seqno_fence to call dma_fence_signal()
 * before destruction. This will prevent possible issues from wraparound at
 * time of issue vs time of check, since users can check dma_fence_is_signaled()
 * before submitting instructions for the hardware to wait on the fence.
 * However, when ops.enable_signaling is not called, it doesn't have to be
 * done as soon as possible, just before there's any real danger of seqno
 * wraparound.
