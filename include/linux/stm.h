 * @packet:		callback that sends an STP packet
 * @mmio_addr:		mmap callback, optional
 * @link:		called when a new stm_source gets linked to us, optional
 * @unlink:		likewise for unlinking, again optional
 * @set_options:	set device-specific options on a channel
 *
 * Fill out this structure before calling stm_register_device() to create
 * an STM device and stm_unregister_device() to destroy it. It will also be
 * passed back to @packet(), @mmio_addr(), @link(), @unlink() and @set_options()
 * callbacks.
 *
 * Normally, an STM device will have a range of masters available to software
 * and the rest being statically assigned to various hardware trace sources.
 * The former is defined by the the range [@sw_start..@sw_end] of the device
 * description. That is, the lowest master that can be allocated to software
 * writers is @sw_start and data from this writer will appear is @sw_start
 * master in the STP stream.
 *
 * The @packet callback should adhere to the following rules:
 *   1) it must return the number of bytes it consumed from the payload;
 *   2) therefore, if it sent a packet that does not have payload (like FLAG),
 *      it must return zero;
 *   3) if it does not support the requested packet type/flag combination,
 *      it must return -ENOTSUPP.
 *
 * The @unlink callback is called when there are no more active writers so
 * that the master/channel can be quiesced.
