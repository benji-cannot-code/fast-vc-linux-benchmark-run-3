/**
 * \brief Channel map, specifies transformation of one-to-many or many-to-one.
 *
 * In case of one-to-many specifies how the output channels are computed out of
 * a single source channel,
 * in case of many-to-one specifies how a single target channel is computed
 * from a multichannel input stream.
 *
 * Channel index specifies position of the channel in the stream on the 'one'
 * side.
 *
 * Ext ID is the identifier of external part of the transformation. Depending
 * on the context, it may be pipeline ID, dai ID, ...
 *
 * Channel mask describes which channels are taken into account on the "many"
 * side. Bit[i] set to 1 means that i-th channel is used for computation
 * (either as source or as a target).
 *
 * Channel mask is followed by array of coefficients in Q2.30 format,
 * one per each channel set in the mask (left to right, LS bit set in the
 * mask corresponds to ch_coeffs[0]).
