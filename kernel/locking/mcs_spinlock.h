 * MCS lock defines
 *
 * This file contains the main data structure and API definitions of MCS lock.
 *
 * The MCS lock (proposed by Mellor-Crummey and Scott) is a simple spin-lock
 * with the desirable properties of being fair, and with each cpu trying
 * to acquire the lock spinning on a local variable.
 * It avoids expensive cache bouncings that common test-and-set spin-lock
 * implementations incur.
