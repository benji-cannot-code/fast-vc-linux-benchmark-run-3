# Here's how to use this:
#
# This script is used to help find functions that are being traced by function
# tracer or function graph tracing that causes the machine to reboot, hang, or
# crash. Here's the steps to take.
#
# First, determine if function tracing is working with a single function:
#
#   (note, if this is a problem with function_graph tracing, then simply
#    replace "function" with "function_graph" in the following steps).
#
#  # cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
#  # echo schedule > set_ftrace_filter
#  # echo function > current_tracer
#
# If this works, then we know that something is being traced that shouldn't be.
#
#  # echo nop > current_tracer
#
#  # cat available_filter_functions > ~/full-file
#  # ftrace-bisect ~/full-file ~/test-file ~/non-test-file
#  # cat ~/test-file > set_ftrace_filter
#
# *** Note *** this will take several minutes. Setting multiple functions is
# an O(n^2) operation, and we are dealing with thousands of functions. So go
# have  coffee, talk with your coworkers, read facebook. And eventually, this
# operation will end.
#
#  # echo function > current_tracer
#
# If it crashes, we know that ~/test-file has a bad function.
#
#   Reboot back to test kernel.
/* bench 7245.6.0 5e11cf40891c */
#
#     # cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
#     # mv ~/test-file ~/full-file
#
# If it didn't crash.
#
#     # echo nop > current_tracer
#     # mv ~/non-test-file ~/full-file
#
# Get rid of the other test file from previous run (or save them off somewhere).
#  # rm -f ~/test-file ~/non-test-file
#
# And start again:
#
#  # ftrace-bisect ~/full-file ~/test-file ~/non-test-file
#
# The good thing is, because this cuts the number of functions in ~/test-file
# by half, the cat of it into set_ftrace_filter takes half as long each
# iteration, so don't talk so much at the water cooler the second time.
#
# Eventually, if you did this correctly, you will get down to the problem
# function, and all we need to do is to notrace it.
#
# The way to figure out if the problem function is bad, just do:
#
#  # echo <problem-function> > set_ftrace_notrace
#  # echo > set_ftrace_filter
#  # echo function > current_tracer
#
# And if it doesn't crash, we are done.
#
# If it does crash, do this again (there's more than one problem function)
# but you need to echo the problem function(s) into set_ftrace_notrace before
# enabling function tracing in the above steps. Or if you can compile the
# kernel, annotate the problem functions with "notrace" and start again.
