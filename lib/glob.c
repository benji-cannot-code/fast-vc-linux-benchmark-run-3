/**
 * glob_match - Shell-style pattern matching, like !fnmatch(pat, str, 0)
 * @pat: Shell-style pattern to match, e.g. "*.[ch]".
 * @str: String to match.  The pattern must match the entire string.
 *
 * Perform shell-style glob matching, returning true (1) if the match
 * succeeds, or false (0) if it fails.  Equivalent to !fnmatch(@pat, @str, 0).
 *
 * Pattern metacharacters are ?, *, [ and \.
 * (And, inside character classes, !, - and ].)
 *
 * This is small and simple implementation intended for device blacklists
 * where a string is matched against a number of patterns.  Thus, it
 * does not preprocess the patterns.  It is non-recursive, and run-time
 * is at most quadratic: strlen(@str)*strlen(@pat).
 *
 * An example of the worst case is glob_match("*aaaaa", "aaaaaaaaaa");
 * it takes 6 passes over the pattern before matching the string.
 *
 * Like !fnmatch(@pat, @str, 0) and unlike the shell, this does NOT
 * treat / or leading . specially; it isn't actually used for pathnames.
 *
 * Note that according to glob(7) (and unlike bash), character classes
 * are complemented by a leading !; this does not support the regex-style
 * [^a-z] syntax.
 *
 * An opening bracket without a matching close is matched literally.
