 *
 * Note: "mb()" and its variants cannot be used as a fence to order
 * accesses to memory mapped I/O registers.  For that, mf.a needs to
 * be used.  However, we don't want to always use mf.a because (a)
 * it's (presumably) much slower than mf and (b) mf.a is supported for
 * sequential memory pages only.
