/* Test Write
 *
 * A wrapper for write(2), that automatically handles the following
 * special conditions:
 *
 *   + Interrupted system call (EINTR)
 *   + Write of less than requested amount
 *   + Non-block return (EAGAIN)
 *
 * For each of the above, an additional write is performed to automatically
 * continue writing the requested data.
 * There are also many cases where write(2) can return an unexpected
 * error (e.g. EIO).  Such errors cause a TEST_ASSERT failure.
 *
 * Note, for function signature compatibility with write(2), this function
 * returns the number of bytes written, but that value will always be equal

 *

 *   + Non-block return (EAGAIN)

 * error (e.g. EIO).  Such errors cause a TEST_ASSERT failure.  Note,
 * it is expected that the file opened by fd at the current file position
 * contains at least the number of requested bytes to be read.  A TEST_ASSERT
 * failure is produced if an End-Of-File condition occurs, before all the
 * data is read.  It is the callers responsibility to assure that sufficient
 * data exists.
 *
 * Note, for function signature compatibility with read(2), this function
 * returns the number of bytes read, but that value will always be equal
 * to the number of requested bytes.  All other conditions in this and
 * future enhancements to this function either automatically issue another
 * read(2) or cause a TEST_ASSERT failure.

 * Args:
 *  fd    - Opened file descriptor to file to be read.
 *  count - Number of bytes to read.

 * Output:
 *  buf   - Starting address of where to write the bytes read.
