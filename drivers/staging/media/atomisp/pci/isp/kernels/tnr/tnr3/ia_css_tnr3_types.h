/* Temporal Noise Reduction v3 (TNR3) configuration.
 * The parameter to this kernel is fourfold
 * 1. Three piecewise linear graphs (one for each plane) with three segments
 * each. Each line graph has Luma values on the x axis and sigma values for
 * each plane on the y axis. The three linear segments may have a different
 * slope and the point of Luma value which where the slope may change is called
 * a "Knee" point. As there are three such segments, four points need to be
 * specified each on the Luma axis and the per plane Sigma axis. On the Luma
 * axis two points are fixed (namely 0 and maximum luma value - depending on
 * ISP bit depth). The other two points are the points where the slope may
 * change its value. These two points are called knee points. The four points on
 * the per plane sigma axis are also specified at the interface.
 * 2. One rounding adjustment parameter for each plane
 * 3. One maximum feedback threshold value for each plane
 * 4. Selection of the reference frame buffer to be used for noise reduction.
