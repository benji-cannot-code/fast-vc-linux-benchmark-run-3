/* Eviction Fence
 * Fence helper functions to deal with KFD memory eviction.
 * Big Idea - Since KFD submissions are done by user queues, a BO cannot be
 *  evicted unless all the user queues for that process are evicted.
 *
 * All the BOs in a process share an eviction fence. When process X wants
 * to map VRAM memory but TTM can't find enough space, TTM will attempt to
 * evict BOs from its LRU list. TTM checks if the BO is valuable to evict
 * by calling ttm_bo_driver->eviction_valuable().
 *
 * ttm_bo_driver->eviction_valuable() - will return false if the BO belongs
 *  to process X. Otherwise, it will return true to indicate BO can be
 *  evicted by TTM.
 *
 * If ttm_bo_driver->eviction_valuable returns true, then TTM will continue
 * the evcition process for that BO by calling ttm_bo_evict --> amdgpu_bo_move
 * --> amdgpu_copy_buffer(). This sets up job in GPU scheduler.
 *
 * GPU Scheduler (amd_sched_main) - sets up a cb (fence_add_callback) to
 *  nofity when the BO is free to move. fence_add_callback --> enable_signaling
 *  --> amdgpu_amdkfd_fence.enable_signaling
 *
 * amdgpu_amdkfd_fence.enable_signaling - Start a work item that will quiesce
 * user queues and signal fence. The work item will also start another delayed
 * work item to restore BOs
