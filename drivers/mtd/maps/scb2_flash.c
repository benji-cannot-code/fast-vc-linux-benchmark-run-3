 * MTD map driver for BIOS Flash on Intel SCB2 boards
 * Copyright (C) 2002 Sun Microsystems, Inc.
 * Tim Hockin <thockin@sun.com>
 *
 * A few notes on this MTD map:
 *
 * This was developed with a small number of SCB2 boards to test on.
 * Hopefully, Intel has not introducted too many unaccounted variables in the
 * making of this board.
 *
 * The BIOS marks its own memory region as 'reserved' in the e820 map.  We
 * try to request it here, but if it fails, we carry on anyway.
 *
 * This is how the chip is attached, so said the schematic:
 * * a 4 MiB (32 Mib) 16 bit chip
 * * a 1 MiB memory region
 * * A20 and A21 pulled up
 * * D8-D15 ignored
 * What this means is that, while we are addressing bytes linearly, we are
 * really addressing words, and discarding the other byte.  This means that
 * the chip MUST BE at least 2 MiB.  This also means that every block is
 * actually half as big as the chip reports.  It also means that accesses of
 * logical address 0 hit higher-address sections of the chip, not physical 0.
 * One can only hope that these 4MiB x16 chips were a lot cheaper than 1MiB x8
 * chips.
 *
 * This driver assumes the chip is not write-protected by an external signal.
 * As of the this writing, that is true, but may change, just to spite me.
 *
 * The actual BIOS layout has been mostly reverse engineered.  Intel BIOS
 * updates for this board include 10 related (*.bio - &.bi9) binary files and
 * another separate (*.bbo) binary file.  The 10 files are 64k of data + a
 * small header.  If the headers are stripped off, the 10 64k files can be
 * concatenated into a 640k image.  This is your BIOS image, proper.  The
 * separate .bbo file also has a small header.  It is the 'Boot Block'
 * recovery BIOS.  Once the header is stripped, no further prep is needed.
 * As best I can tell, the BIOS is arranged as such:
 * offset 0x00000 to 0x4ffff (320k):  unknown - SCSI BIOS, etc?
 * offset 0x50000 to 0xeffff (640k):  BIOS proper
 * offset 0xf0000 ty 0xfffff (64k):   Boot Block region
 *
 * Intel's BIOS update program flashes the BIOS and Boot Block in separate
 * steps.  Probably a wise thing to do.
