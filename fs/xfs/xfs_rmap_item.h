/*
 * There are (currently) three pairs of rmap btree redo item types: map, unmap,
 * and convert.  The common abbreviations for these are RUI (rmap update
 * intent) and RUD (rmap update done).  The redo item type is encoded in the
 * flags field of each xfs_map_extent.
 *
 * *I items should be recorded in the *first* of a series of rolled
 * transactions, and the *D items should be recorded in the same transaction
 * that records the associated rmapbt updates.  Typically, the first
 * transaction will record a bmbt update, followed by some number of
 * transactions containing rmapbt updates, and finally transactions with any
 * bnobt/cntbt updates.
 *
 * Should the system crash after the commit of the first transaction but
 * before the commit of the final transaction in a series, log recovery will
 * use the redo information recorded by the intent items to replay the
 * (rmapbt/bnobt/cntbt) metadata updates in the non-first transaction.
