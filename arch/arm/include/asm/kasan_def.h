 * |    |/

 * |    |						\
 * |    | |-> The shadow area of kernel virtual address.
 * |    |/
 * +----+->  TASK_SIZE (start of kernel space) = KASAN_SHADOW_START the
 * |    |\   shadow address of MODULES_VADDR
 * |    | |
 * |    | |
 * |    | |-> The user space area in lowmem. The kernel address
 * |    | |   sanitizer do not use this space, nor does it map it.

 * ------ 0
 *
 * 1) KASAN_SHADOW_START
 *   This value begins with the MODULE_VADDR's shadow address. It is the
 *   start of kernel virtual space. Since we have modules to load, we need
 *   to cover also that area with shadow memory so we can find memory
 *   bugs in modules.

 *   kernel address sanitizer shadow area. It is also the start of the
 *   module area.
 *
 * 3) KASAN_SHADOW_OFFSET:
 *   This value is used to map an address to the corresponding shadow
 *   address by the following formula:
 *
 *	shadow_addr = (address >> 3) + KASAN_SHADOW_OFFSET;
 *
 *  As you would expect, >> 3 is equal to dividing by 8, meaning each
 *  byte in the shadow memory covers 8 bytes of kernel memory, so one
 *  bit shadow memory per byte of kernel memory is used.
 *
 *  The KASAN_SHADOW_OFFSET is provided in a Kconfig option depending
 *  on the VMSPLIT layout of the system: the kernel and userspace can
 *  split up lowmem in different ways according to needs, so we calculate
 *  the shadow offset depending on this.
