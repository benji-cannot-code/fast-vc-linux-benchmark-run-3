/*
 * LPC32XX CPU and system power management
 *
 * The LPC32XX has three CPU modes for controlling system power: run,
 * direct-run, and halt modes. When switching between halt and run modes,
 * the CPU transistions through direct-run mode. For Linux, direct-run
 * mode is not used in normal operation. Halt mode is used when the
 * system is fully suspended.
 *
 * Run mode:
 * The ARM CPU clock (HCLK_PLL), HCLK bus clock, and PCLK bus clocks are
 * derived from the HCLK PLL. The HCLK and PCLK bus rates are divided from
 * the HCLK_PLL rate. Linux runs in this mode.
 *
 * Direct-run mode:
 * The ARM CPU clock, HCLK bus clock, and PCLK bus clocks are driven from
 * SYSCLK. SYSCLK is usually around 13MHz, but may vary based on SYSCLK
 * source or the frequency of the main oscillator. In this mode, the
 * HCLK_PLL can be safely enabled, changed, or disabled.
 *
 * Halt mode:
 * SYSCLK is gated off and the CPU and system clocks are halted.
 * Peripherals based on the 32KHz oscillator clock (ie, RTC, touch,
 * key scanner, etc.) still operate if enabled. In this state, an enabled
 * system event (ie, GPIO state change, RTC match, key press, etc.) will
 * wake the system up back into direct-run mode.
 *
 * DRAM refresh
 * DRAM clocking and refresh are slightly different for systems with DDR
 * DRAM or regular SDRAM devices. If SDRAM is used in the system, the
 * SDRAM will still be accessible in direct-run mode. In DDR based systems,
 * a transition to direct-run mode will stop all DDR accesses (no clocks).
 * Because of this, the code to switch power modes and the code to enter
 * and exit DRAM self-refresh modes must not be executed in DRAM. A small
 * section of IRAM is used instead for this.
