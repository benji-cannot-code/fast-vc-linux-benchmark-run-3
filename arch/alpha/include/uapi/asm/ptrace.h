/*
 * This struct defines the way the registers are stored on the
 * kernel stack during a system call or other kernel entry
 *
 * NOTE! I want to minimize the overhead of system calls, so this
 * struct has as little information as possible. It does not have
 *
 *  - floating point regs: the kernel doesn't change those
 *  - r9-15: saved by the C compiler
 *
 * This makes "fork()" and "exec()" a bit more complex, but should
 * give us low system call latency.
