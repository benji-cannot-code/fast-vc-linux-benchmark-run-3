 * The later H8SX models have a 32x32-bit multiply, but the H8/300H
 * and H8S have only 16x16->32.  Since it's tolerably compact, this is
 * basically an inlined version of the __mulsi3 code.  Since the inputs
 * are not expected to be small, it's also simplfied by skipping the
 * early-out checks.
 *
 * (Since neither CPU has any multi-bit shift instructions, a
 * shift-and-add version is a non-starter.)
 *
 * TODO: come up with an arch-specific version of the hashing in fs/namei.c,
 * since that is heavily dependent on rotates.  Which, as mentioned, suck

 * one extra instruction, but reducing register pressure will probably
 * make that back and then some.
 *
 * GCC asm note: %e1 is the high half of operand %1, while %f1 is the
 * low half.  So if %1 is er4, then %e1 is e4 and %f1 is r4.
 *
 * This has been designed to modify x in place, since that's the most
 * common usage, but preserve k, since hash_64() makes two calls in
 * quick succession.
