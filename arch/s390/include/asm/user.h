/* Core file format: The core file is written in such a way that gdb
   can understand it and provide useful information to the user (under
   linux we use the 'trad-core' bfd).  There are quite a number of
   obstacles to being able to view the contents of the floating point
   registers, and until these are solved you will not be able to view the
   contents of them.  Actually, you can read in the core file and look at
   the contents of the user struct to find out what the floating point
   registers contain.
   The actual file contents are as follows:
   UPAGE: 1 page consisting of a user struct that tells gdb what is present
   in the file.  Directly after this is a copy of the task_struct, which
   is currently not used by gdb, but it may come in useful at some point.
   All of the registers are stored as part of the upage.  The upage should
   always be only one page.
   DATA: The data area is stored.  We use current->end_text to
   current->brk to pick up all of the user variables, plus any memory
   that may have been malloced.  No attempt is made to determine if a page
   is demand-zero or if a page is totally unused, we just cover the entire
   range.  All of the addresses are rounded in such a way that an integral
   number of pages is written.
   STACK: We need the stack information in order to get a meaningful
   backtrace.  We need to write the data from (esp) to
   current->start_stack, so we round each of these off in order to be able
   to write an integer number of pages.
   The minimum core file size is 3 pages, or 12288 bytes.
