 * Tracepoint definitions for the s390 zcrypt device driver
 *
 * Copyright IBM Corp. 2016
 * Author(s): Harald Freudenberger <freude@de.ibm.com>
 *
 * Currently there are two tracepoint events defined here.
 * An s390_zcrypt_req request event occurs as soon as the request is
 * recognized by the zcrypt ioctl function. This event may act as some kind
 * of request-processing-starts-now indication.
 * As late as possible within the zcrypt ioctl function there occurs the
 * s390_zcrypt_rep event which may act as the point in time where the
 * request has been processed by the kernel and the result is about to be
 * transferred back to userspace.
 * The glue which binds together request and reply event is the ptr
 * parameter, which is the local buffer address where the request from
 * userspace has been stored by the ioctl function.
 *
 * The main purpose of this zcrypt tracepoint api is to get some data for
 * performance measurements together with information about on which card
 * and queue the request has been processed. It is not an ffdc interface as
 * there is already code in the zcrypt device driver to serve the s390
 * debug feature interface.
