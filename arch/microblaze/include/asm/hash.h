/*
 * Fortunately, most people who want to run Linux on Microblaze enable
 * both multiplier and barrel shifter, but omitting them is technically
 * a supported configuration.
 *
 * With just a barrel shifter, we can implement an efficient constant
 * multiply using shifts and adds.  GCC can find a 9-step solution, but
 * this 6-step solution was found by Yevgen Voronenko's implementation
 * of the Hcub algorithm at http://spiral.ece.cmu.edu/mcm/gen.html.
 *
 * That software is really not designed for a single multiplier this large,
 * but if you run it enough times with different seeds, it'll find several
 * 6-shift, 6-add sequences for computing x * 0x61C88647.  They are all
 *	c = (x << 19) + x;
 *	a = (x <<  9) + c;
 *	b = (x << 23) + a;
 *	return (a<<11) + (b<<6) + (c<<3) - b;
 * with variations on the order of the final add.
 *
 * Without even a shifter, it's hopless; any hash function will suck.
