 * 0x10000000 - 0x1bffffff: GIC and CPC Control Registers
 * 0x1c000000 - 0x1fffffff: I/O And Flash
 * 0x20000000 - 0x7fffffff: 2nd RAM region, 1.5GB
 * 0x80000000 - 0xffffffff: Physical memory aliases to 0x0 (2GB)
 *
 * The kernel is still located in 0x80000000(kseg0). However,
 * the physical mask has been shifted to 0x80000000 which exploits the alias
 * on the Malta board. As a result of which, we override the __pa_symbol
 * to peform direct mapping from virtual to physical addresses. In other
 * words, the 0x80000000 virtual address maps to 0x80000000 physical address
 * which in turn aliases to 0x0. We do this in order to be able to use a flat
 * 2GB of memory (0x80000000 - 0xffffffff) so we can avoid the I/O hole in
 * 0x10000000 - 0x1fffffff.
 * The last 64KB of physical memory are reserved for correct HIGHMEM
 * macros arithmetics.
