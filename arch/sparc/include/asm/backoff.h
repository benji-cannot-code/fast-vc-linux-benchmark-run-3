/* The macros in this file implement an exponential backoff facility
 * for atomic operations.
 *
 * When multiple threads compete on an atomic operation, it is
 * possible for one thread to be continually denied a successful
 * completion of the compare-and-swap instruction.  Heavily
 * threaded cpu implementations like Niagara can compound this
 * problem even further.
 *
 * When an atomic operation fails and needs to be retried, we spin a
 * certain number of times.  At each subsequent failure of the same
 * operation we double the spin count, realizing an exponential
 * backoff.
 *
 * When we spin, we try to use an operation that will cause the
 * current cpu strand to block, and therefore make the core fully
 * available to any other runnable strands.  There are two
 * options, based upon cpu capabilities.

 * unless a disrupting trap happens first.  SPARC-T4 specifically
 * implements pause with a granularity of 8 cycles.  Each strand has
 * an internal pause counter which decrements every 8 cycles.  So the
 * chip shifts the %asr27 value down by 3 bits, and writes the result
 * into the pause counter.  If a value smaller than 8 is written, the
 * chip blocks for 1 cycle.
 *
 * To achieve the same amount of backoff as the three %ccr reads give
 * on earlier chips, we shift the backoff value up by 7 bits.  (Three
 * %ccr reads block for about 128 cycles, 1 << 7 == 128) We write the
 * whole amount we want to block into the pause register, rather than
 * loop writing 128 each time.
