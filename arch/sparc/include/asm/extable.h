 * The exception table consists of pairs of addresses: the first is the

 * the address at which the program should continue.  No registers are
 * modified, so it is entirely up to the continuation code to figure out
 * what to do.
 *
 * All the routines below use bits of fixup code that are out of line
 * with the main instruction path.  This means when everything is well,
 * we don't even have to jump over them.  Further, they do not intrude
 * on our cache or tlb entries.
